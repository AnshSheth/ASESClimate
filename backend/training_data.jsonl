That is, they relied on differences in the features of the\norganisms in a population and on the ability of these different features to be\npassed on to offspring.\nDarwin did not, however, know how traits were inherited. Like other scientists\nof his time, he thought that traits were passed on via blending inheritance.

The blending model was disproven by Austrian monk\u00a0Gregor\nMendel, who found that traits are speci\ufb01ed by non-blending heritable units\ncalled genes.\nAlthough Mendel published his work on genetics just a few years after Darwin\npublished his ideas on evolution, Darwin probably never read Mendel\u2019s work.\nToday, we can combine Darwin\u2019s and Mendel\u2019s ideas to arrive at a clearer\nunderstanding of what evolution is and how it takes place.\nMicroevolution and population genetics\nMicroevolution, or evolution on a small scale, is de\ufb01ned as a change in the\nfrequency of gene variants, alleles, in a population over generations. The \ufb01eld\nof biology that studies allele frequencies in populations and how they change\nover time is called\u00a0population genetics.\nMicroevolution is sometimes contrasted with\u00a0macroevolution, evolution that\ninvolves large changes, such as formation of new groups or species, and\nhappens over long time periods. However, most biologists view\nmicroevolution and macroevolution as the same process happening on\ndifferent timescales. Microevolution adds up gradually, over long periods of\ntime to produce macroevolutionary changes.\nLet's look at three concepts that are core to the de\ufb01nition of microevolution:\npopulations, alleles, and allele frequency.\nPopulations\nA\u00a0population\u00a0is a group of organisms of the same species that are found in\nthe same area and can interbreed. A population is the smallest unit that can\nevolve\u2014in other words, an individual can\u2019t evolve.\nAlleles\nAn\u00a0allele\u00a0is a version of a\u00a0gene, a heritable unit that controls a particular\nfeature of an organism.\nFor instance, Mendel studied a gene that controls \ufb02ower color in pea plants.\nThis gene comes in a white allele,\u00a0w, and a purple allele,\u00a0W. Each pea plant\n2/8/25, 3:24 PM Allele frequency & the gene pool (article) | Khan Academy\nhttps://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-biology/natural-selection/hardy-weinberg-equilibrium/a/allele-frequency-the-gene-pool?utm_source=chatgpt.com 2/6\nhas two gene copies, which may be the same or different alleles. When the\nalleles are different, one\u2014the\u00a0dominant\u00a0allele,\u00a0W\u2014may hide the other\u2014\nthe\u00a0recessive allele,\u00a0w. A plant's set of alleles, called its\u00a0genotype,\ndetermines its\u00a0phenotype, or observable features, in this case \ufb02ower color.\nAllele frequency\nAllele frequency\u00a0refers to how frequently a particular allele appears in a\npopulation. For instance, if all the alleles in a population of pea plants were\npurple alleles,\u00a0W, the allele frequency of\u00a0W\u00a0would be 100%, or 1.0. However,\nif half the alleles were\u00a0W\u00a0and half were\u00a0w, each allele would have an allele\nfrequency of 50%, or 0.5.\nIn general, we can de\ufb01ne allele frequency as\n\u00a0\u00a0\nSometimes there are more than two alleles in a population (e.g., there might\nbe\u00a0A,\u00a0a, and\u00a0\u00a0alleles of a gene). In that case, you would want to add up\u00a0all\u00a0of\nthe different alleles to get your denominator.\nIt's also possible to calculate\u00a0genotype frequencies\u2014the fraction of\nindividuals with a given genotype\u2014and\u00a0phenotype frequencies\u2014the\nfraction of individuals with a given phenotype. Keep in mind, though, that\nthese are different concepts from allele frequency. We'll see an example of\nthis difference next.\nExample: Finding allele frequency\nLet\u2019s look at an example. Consider the very small population of nine pea\nplants shown below. Each pea plant has two copies of the \ufb02ower color gene.\n2/8/25, 3:24 PM Allele frequency & the gene pool (article) | Khan Academy\nhttps://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-biology/natural-selection/hardy-weinberg-equilibrium/a/allele-frequency-the-gene-pool?utm_source=chatgpt.com 3/6\nIf we look at the two gene copies in\neach plant and count up how\nmany\u00a0W\u00a0copies are present, we\n\ufb01nd there are 13. If we count up\nhow many\u00a0w\u00a0copies are present,\nwe \ufb01nd that there are \ufb01ve. The\ntotal number of gene copies in the\nwhole population is\u00a0 .\nWe can divide the number of\ncopies of each allele by the total\nnumber of copies to get the allele\nfrequency. By convention, when\nthere are just two alleles for a gene\nin a population, their frequencies are given the symbols\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0, or\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0, or\u00a0\nThe frequencies of all the alleles of a gene must add up to one, or 100%.\nAllele frequency is different from genotype frequency or phenotype frequency.\nGenotype and phenotype frequencies can also be calculated and are\nimportant for understanding how populations evolve, but they are not the\nsame thing as allele frequency. The diagram below shows the difference:\n2/8/25, 3:24 PM Allele frequency & the gene pool (article) | Khan Academy\nhttps://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-biology/natural-selection/hardy-weinberg-equilibrium/a/allele-frequency-the-gene-pool?utm_source=chatgpt.com 4/6\nNow, let\u2019s suppose we come back a generation later and check the\ngenotypes of the new pea plants that now make up the population. To \ufb01nd the\nallele frequencies, we again look at each individual\u2019s genotype, count the\nnumber of copies of each allele, and divide by the total number of gene\ncopies. Now, we \ufb01nd the frequency of\u00a0W\u00a0has dropped to\u00a0 , or 44%, and the\nfrequency of\u00a0w\u00a0has risen to\u00a0, or 56%.\nThere has been a change in allele frequencies in the population over\ngenerations, so\u2014by the de\ufb01nition of microevolution\u2014we can say that the\n2/8/25, 3:24 PM Allele frequency & the gene pool (article) | Khan Academy\nhttps://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-biology/natural-selection/hardy-weinberg-equilibrium/a/allele-frequency-the-gene-pool?utm_source=chatgpt.com 5/6\npopulation has evolved. If we were actually doing research, we might want to\nuse a statistical test to con\ufb01rm that these proportions were really different.\nWe\u2019ll examine the factors that cause a population to evolve, including natural\nselection, genetic drift\u2014random change\u2014and others factors, in the rest of\nthis tutorial.\nThe gene pool\nThe total set of gene copies for all genes in a population is referred to as\nits\u00a0gene pool. The gene pool gets its name from the idea that we are\nessentially taking all the gene copies\u2014for all genes\u2014in the individuals of a\npopulation and dumping them into one large, common pool.\nWhat would this look like? In the example above, we went through all nine\nindividuals in the population and looked at their copies of the \ufb02ower color\ngene. There were 18 individual gene copies, each of which was a\u00a0W\u00a0or\na\u00a0w\u00a0allele. Now, imagine that we went through this same process for every\nsingle gene in the pea plant, including genes that control height, seed color,\nseed shape, metabolism, etc. There would be 18 copies of each gene pulled\nout and dumped into the common pool. At the end of this process, the\ncommon pool of gene copies will be the gene pool of our population.\nBy looking at all the copies of all the genes in a population, we can see\nglobally how much genetic variation there is in the population. The more\nvariation a population has, the better its ability to adapt to changes in its\nenvironment through natural selection. If there is more variation, the odds are\nbetter that there will be some alleles already present that allow organisms to\nsurvive and reproduce effectively under the new conditions.\n2/8/25, 3:24 PM Allele frequency & the gene pool (article) | Khan Academy\nhttps://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-biology/natural-selection/hardy-weinberg-equilibrium/a/allele-frequency-the-gene-pool?utm_source=chatgpt.com 6/6\n\n\nExample of climate integration:\n  \nEcosystem\n \nLesson:\n \nAllele\n \nFrequency\n \nand\n \nClimate\n  Created  By  Grades  Subjects  Duration  \nChrista  Delaney  9th-12th  Science  \u2245  95  minutes   \nLesson  Overview\n \nEssential  Questions  \n\u25cf  How  is  climate  change  changing  the  environment?  \u25cf  How  can  changing  environments  affect  the  genetics  of  organisms?  \u25cf  Why  is  it  important  to  understand  allele  frequencies?  \u25cf  What  are  the  bene\ufb01ts  and  drawbacks  of  allele  frequencies  within  a  population?  \nLearning  Outcomes  \nStudents  will  be  able  to  \u25cf  Calculate  allele  frequency.  \u25cf  Mathematically  express  how  traits  may  vary  over  time  as  a  result  of  climate  change.  \u25cf  Identify  the  bene\ufb01ts  and  drawbacks  of  changes  in  a  gene  pool.  \u25cf  Explain  how  climate  change  affects  the  diet  of  Arctic  communities.  \nSummary  \nIn  this  lesson,  students  explore  the  impact  of  environmental  changes  on  an  organism's  allele  frequency.   Inquire:  Students  watch  a  video  on  peppered  moths  and  identify  vocabulary  related  to  allele  frequency.  Investigate:  Students  play  a  game  to  understand  allele  frequency  changes  that  can  occur  in  species  impacted  by  changing  environments.  Inspire:  Students  explore  how  climate  change  is  impacting  native  Arctic  communities  and  complete  a  project  describing  how  climate  change  is  impacting  animals  in  the  Arctic.   \nInstructions\n \nInquire  \n\u2245\n \n20\n \nminutes\n \n\u25cf  Students  watch Evolution  of  the  Peppered  Moth  by  Natural  Selection.  \u25cf  After  watching  the  video,  students  answer  the  following  questions  in  their  Student  Document:  \u25cb  What  facts  or  data  stood  out  to  you?  \u25cb  What  do  you  wonder  about  this  video?  \u25cb  How  do  you  feel  after  watching  this  video?  \u25cb  What  environmental  factor  affected  the  peppered  moths?  \u25cb  Was  the  factor  human-caused  (anthropogenic)  or  natural?  \u25cf  Teacher  recaps  the  video,  explaining  that  the  peppered  moths  underwent  natural  selection  due  to  an  environmental  change,  which  led  to  a  change  in  their  genetic  variability.  If  the  environment  changes,  it  can  have  a  direct  effect  on  the  gene  pool  of  a  population.  \u25cf  Teacher  reviews  vocabulary  terms  with  students  using  the  glossary  slide  in  the  Teacher  Slideshow,  and  students  write  the  de\ufb01nitions  in  their  Student  Document.  \u25cf  Students  watch this  video  clip (1:38-3:39)  from  NOAA\u2019s  2022  Arctic  Report  Card  as  a  whole  \n \n\n  \nclass  together.  \u25cf  Teacher  asks  students,  \u201cWhat  physical  changes  are  happening  in  the  Arctic\u2019s  environment?  Students  may  mention  any  of  the  following:  \u25cb  The  Arctic  is  warming  due  to  human-induced  climate  change,  and  it\u2019s  warming  faster  than  the  rest  of  the  planet.  \u25cb  Precipitation  in  the  Arctic  is  increasing.  \u25cb  The  precipitation  is  more  likely  to  fall  as  rain  than  as  snow,  causing  the  Arctic  to  transition  to  a  \u201crain-dominated\u201d  climate.  \u25cf  Teacher  uses  the  following  review  questions  in  the  Teacher  Slideshow  to  quiz  students  on  allele  frequencies:  \n\u25cb\n \nIn  a  snowy  climate,  which  prey  animals  are  more  likely  to  survive:  those  that  are  darker  in  color  or  those  that  are  lighter  in  color?  Lighter  in  color  \n\u25cb  \nIf  the  alleles  for  being  light  in  color  are  recessive,  which  alleles  are  more  likely  to  be  passed  on  in  this  environment  from  parent  to  offspring:  recessive  or  dominant?  Recessive  \n\u25cb  \nWhat  would  happen  to  the  gene  pool  if  there  were  less  snow  on  the  ground  or  less  land  ice?  Would  there  be  more  recessive  alleles  or  more  dominant  alleles  in  the  gene  pool?  Dominant  \n\u25cb  \nHow  might  climate  change  affect  the  alleles  found  in  the  gene  pool  of  organisms  that  live  in  the  Arctic  in  the  future?  The  genetic  diversity  will  decrease  because  there  will  be  a  lower  number  of  organisms  with  recessive  alleles.  \nInvestigate  \u2245  45  minutes \n\u25cf  Students  play  a  game  to  simulate  changing  allele  frequencies  in  an  Arctic  biome.  Teacher  prints  at  least  20  of  each  of  the  game  cards so  there  is  a  high  number  of  organisms  in  the  population  to  start.  \u25cf  Students  receive  game  cards  that  have  imaginary  organisms  on  them.  \u25cb  The  cards  represent  different  organisms  that  live  in  an  Arctic  biome.  \u25cb  Some  organisms  are  light  in  color,  and  some  are  dark  in  color.  \u25cb  Each  organism  is  either  adapted  to  white  environments,  such  as  snow,  or  darker  environments,  such  as  soil.  \u25cf  Students  complete  Round  1  following  the  instructions  for  the  game  below:  \u25cb  As  a  group,  students  use  the  Student  Document  to  \ufb01ll  out  their  allele  frequency  sheets  with  the  number  of  alleles  present  in  their  environment  at  the  beginning  of  the  game.  \u25a0  Students  look  at  the  back  of  the  cards  with  the  organisms  on  them  and  count  the  number  of  uppercase  B  alleles  and  lowercase  b  alleles  present  in  their  population.  \u25a0  Students  add  together  the  uppercase  B  and  lowercase  b  alleles  to  see  how  many  alleles  total  are  present  in  their  population.  \u25a0  Teacher  reminds  students  that  BB  alleles  are  dominant  and  the  phenotype  would  be  black.  The  Bb  alleles  also  would  present  the  phenotype  as  black.  The  bb  alleles  are  recessive  and  would  present  the  phenotype  as  white.  \u25a0  Students  \ufb01nd  allele  frequency  percentages.  \u25cb  One  student  will  be  the  predator.  The  predator  waits  outside.  \u25cb  Students  place  their  organism  cards  on  an  all-white  background.  This  all-white  \n \n\n  \nbackground  could  be  construction  paper,  a  tarp,  or  a  sheet.  \u25cb  When  the  teacher  says  \u201cgo,\u201d  the  predator  walks  into  the  classroom  and  tries  to  \ufb01nd  as  many  organisms  as  they  can  in  20  seconds.  \u25a0  If  the  predator  picks  up  the  card,  this  means  that  the  organism  was  eaten.  \u25a0  The  other  students  stand  outside  of  the  predator\u2019s  environment  and  do  not  offer  help  or  interfere.  \u25cb  After  20  seconds,  students,  as  a  class,  count  the  remaining  lighter-colored  and  darker-colored  organisms.  \u25a0  Teacher  explains  that  Round  1  represents  one  generation  passing.  \u25a0  As  a  group,  students  \ufb02ip  over  their  cards  to  see  the  genotype  of  their  organisms.  \u25a0  Students  \ufb01nd  the  percentage  of  alleles  present  in  their  gene  pool  after  Round  1.  \u25cf  Students  count  the  number  of  alleles  left  on  the  tarp.  \u25cf  Students  count  letter  B  alleles  and  lowercase  b  alleles  and  then  add  them  together  to  get  the  total.  \u25cf  Students  \ufb01nd  allele  frequency  percentages.  \u25cb  The  predator  leaves  the  classroom  to  prepare  for  Round  2  of  the  game.  \u25cf  Students  complete  Round  2  of  the  game,  using  the  following  instructions:  \u25cb  Teacher  and  students  place  all  the  cards  back  in  the  game  for  Round  2,  even  cards  that  were  previously  picked  up  in  Round  1.  The  game  completely  starts  over.  \u25cb  This  time,  students  place  the  organism  cards  on  a  dark  background.  This  could  be  a  large  sheet  of  black  construction  paper,  a  sheet,  or  a  tarp.  \u25cb  When  the  teacher  says  \u201cGo,\u201d  the  predator  enters  the  room.  \u25cb  The  predator  tries  to  \ufb01nd  as  many  organisms  as  they  can  in  20  seconds.  \u25cb  Students  calculate  the  allele  frequency  of  the  organisms  living  in  this  imaginary  Arctic  biome  after  Round  2.  \u25a0  As  a  group,  students  \ufb02ip  over  their  cards  to  see  the  genotype  of  their  organism.  \u25a0  Students  count  how  many  alleles  are  present  in  their  population  at  the  end  of  Round  2.  \u25a0  Teacher  explains  that  Round  2  represents  one  generation  passing  in  this  new  environment.  \u25a0  Students  \ufb01nd  the  percentage  of  alleles  present  in  their  gene  pool.  This  is  done  by  counting  the  number  of  alleles  left  on  the  tarp.  Students  count  letter  B  alleles  and  lowercase  b  alleles  and  then  add  together  this  number  to  get  the  total.  \u25cf  The  rounds  of  the  game  can  be  repeated  if  needed.  \u25cf  At  the  end  of  the  game,  students  complete  the  Summary  Statement  section  of  the  Student  Document.  \u25cf  Students  come  back  together  as  a  large  group  and  discuss  the  following  scenario:  Imagine  a  snowy  environment  changing  to  a  wetter,  forest-like  environment  where  the  soil  is  more  visible,  similar  to  the  white  background  changing  to  a  darker  background  in  the  game.  \u25cf  Students  discuss  the  following  questions:  \n \n\n  \n\u25cb  What  would  be  potential  bene\ufb01ts  to  organisms  if  an  environment  changed  from  a  snowy  environment  to  a  forest  environment?  Easier  to  \ufb01nd  food,  more  plants  growing  in  soil,  and  more  habitats  and  niches  for  organisms  to  occupy.  \u25cb  What  would  be  potential  drawbacks  for  organisms  if  an  environment  changed  from  a  snowy  environment  to  a  forest  environment?  Less  genetic  diversity,  less  habitat  diversity,  less  biodiversity,  and  unforeseen  consequences  that  humans  are  unaware  of .  \nInspire  \u2245   30  minutes\n \n\u25cf  Students  watch  Erosion  in  Alaska:  Youth  and  Climate,  a  video  about  a  community  that  faces  challenges  due  to  a  changing  climate.  \u25cf  Students  participate  in  a  group  discussion  on  the  video  using  the  following  questions:  \u25cb  How  would  a  change  from  snowy  conditions  to  a  warmer  environment  affect  the  lifestyle  of  this  community?  The  people  might  have  to  change  how  they  get  their  food  and  where  they  live.  \u25cb  How  could  a  change  from  a  snowy  environment  to  a  more  forest-like  environment  affect  the  Alaskan  community\u2019s  diet?  There  could  be  less  \ufb01shing  and  this  would  affect  the  communities'  ability  to  \ufb01nd  food.  If  the  tundra  becomes  a  more  forest-like  environment,  the  community  could  plant  crops  and  raise  livestock  but  that  cannot  happen  on  unstable,  melting  permafrost.  \u25cb  How  does  Nelson  feel  about  the  changes?  He  feels  scared  that  his  community  will  lose  their  way  of  life.  \u25cf  Students  independently  read  this  article about  climate  migrants  and  watch  Alaskan  Native  Elders  Tell  Their  Climate  Change  Story:  After  the  Ice.  Note:  There  are  three  short  videos  in  this  series.  Teacher  can  assign  the  video  above,  which  is  the  third  video,  or  all  three.  \u25cf  Students  answer  the  following  questions  on  their  Student  Document:  \u25cb  What  does  the  term  climate  migrant  mean  to  you?   \u25cb  How  could  the  community  in  the  video  be  an  example  of  climate  migration?  \u25cb  How  would  you  feel  if  you  had  to  leave  your  community?  \u25cb  How  is  this  community  currently  being  affected  by  climate  change?  \u25cb  Do  you  think  all  communities  everywhere  are  being  affected  by  climate  change  in  the  same  way?  \u25cb  What  solutions  does  the  article  suggest?  If  you  had  to  choose  one  solution  to  focus  on,  which  would  you  choose?  Why?  \u25cf  Students  work  in  small  groups  to  create  a  mini-project  about  a  group  of  animals  (wild  \ufb01sh,  crustaceans,  marine  mammals,  Arctic  seabirds,  or  land  animals)  that  will  be  affected  by  climate  change  in  the  Arctic.  \u25cb  Students  use  this  Climate  Hub to  choose  a  group  of  animals.

Inquire:  Students  watch  a  video  on  peppered  moths  and  identify  vocabulary  related  to  allele  frequency.  Investigate:  Students  play  a  game  to  understand  allele  frequency  changes  that  can  occur  in  species  impacted  by  changing  environments.  Inspire:  Students  explore  how  climate  change  is  impacting  native  Arctic  communities  and  complete  a  project  describing  how  climate  change  is  impacting  animals  in  the  Arctic.   \nInstructions\n \nInquire  \n\u2245\n \n20\n \nminutes\n \n\u25cf  Students  watch Evolution  of  the  Peppered  Moth  by  Natural  Selection.  \u25cf  After  watching  the  video,  students  answer  the  following  questions  in  their  Student  Document:  \u25cb  What  facts  or  data  stood  out  to  you?  \u25cb  What  do  you  wonder  about  this  video?  \u25cb  How  do  you  feel  after  watching  this  video?  \u25cb  What  environmental  factor  affected  the  peppered  moths?  \u25cb  Was  the  factor  human-caused  (anthropogenic)  or  natural?  \u25cf  Teacher  recaps  the  video,  explaining  that  the  peppered  moths  underwent  natural  selection  due  to  an  environmental  change,  which  led  to  a  change  in  their  genetic  variability.  If  the  environment  changes,  it  can  have  a  direct  effect  on  the  gene  pool  of  a  population.  \u25cf  Teacher  reviews  vocabulary  terms  with  students  using  the  glossary  slide  in  the  Teacher  Slideshow,  and  students  write  the  de\ufb01nitions  in  their  Student  Document.  \u25cf  Students  watch this  video  clip (1:38-3:39)  from  NOAA\u2019s  2022  Arctic  Report  Card  as  a  whole  \n \n\n  \nclass  together.  \u25cf  Teacher  asks  students,  \u201cWhat  physical  changes  are  happening  in  the  Arctic\u2019s  environment?  Students  may  mention  any  of  the  following:  \u25cb  The  Arctic  is  warming  due  to  human-induced  climate  change,  and  it\u2019s  warming  faster  than  the  rest  of  the  planet.  \u25cb  Precipitation  in  the  Arctic  is  increasing.  \u25cb  The  precipitation  is  more  likely  to  fall  as  rain  than  as  snow,  causing  the  Arctic  to  transition  to  a  \u201crain-dominated\u201d  climate.  \u25cf  Teacher  uses  the  following  review  questions  in  the  Teacher  Slideshow  to  quiz  students  on  allele  frequencies:  \n\u25cb\n \nIn  a  snowy  climate,  which  prey  animals  are  more  likely  to  survive:  those  that  are  darker  in  color  or  those  that  are  lighter  in  color?  Lighter  in  color  \n\u25cb  \nIf  the  alleles  for  being  light  in  color  are  recessive,  which  alleles  are  more  likely  to  be  passed  on  in  this  environment  from  parent  to  offspring:  recessive  or  dominant?  Recessive  \n\u25cb  \nWhat  would  happen  to  the  gene  pool  if  there  were  less  snow  on  the  ground  or  less  land  ice?  Would  there  be  more  recessive  alleles  or  more  dominant  alleles  in  the  gene  pool?  Dominant  \n\u25cb  \nHow  might  climate  change  affect  the  alleles  found  in  the  gene  pool  of  organisms  that  live  in  the  Arctic  in  the  future?  The  genetic  diversity  will  decrease  because  there  will  be  a  lower  number  of  organisms  with  recessive  alleles.  \nInvestigate  \u2245  45  minutes \n\u25cf  Students  play  a  game  to  simulate  changing  allele  frequencies  in  an  Arctic  biome.  Teacher  prints  at  least  20  of  each  of  the  game  cards so  there  is  a  high  number  of  organisms  in  the  population  to  start.  \u25cf  Students  receive  game  cards  that  have  imaginary  organisms  on  them.  \u25cb  The  cards  represent  different  organisms  that  live  in  an  Arctic  biome.  \u25cb  Some  organisms  are  light  in  color,  and  some  are  dark  in  color.  \u25cb  Each  organism  is  either  adapted  to  white  environments,  such  as  snow,  or  darker  environments,  such  as  soil.  \u25cf  Students  complete  Round  1  following  the  instructions  for  the  game  below:  \u25cb  As  a  group,  students  use  the  Student  Document  to  \ufb01ll  out  their  allele  frequency  sheets  with  the  number  of  alleles  present  in  their  environment  at  the  beginning  of  the  game.  \u25a0  Students  look  at  the  back  of  the  cards  with  the  organisms  on  them  and  count  the  number  of  uppercase  B  alleles  and  lowercase  b  alleles  present  in  their  population.  \u25a0  Students  add  together  the  uppercase  B  and  lowercase  b  alleles  to  see  how  many  alleles  total  are  present  in  their  population.  \u25a0  Teacher  reminds  students  that  BB  alleles  are  dominant  and  the  phenotype  would  be  black.  The  Bb  alleles  also  would  present  the  phenotype  as  black.  The  bb  alleles  are  recessive  and  would  present  the  phenotype  as  white.  \u25a0  Students  \ufb01nd  allele  frequency  percentages.  \u25cb  One  student  will  be  the  predator.  The  predator  waits  outside.  \u25cb  Students  place  their  organism  cards  on  an  all-white  background.  This  all-white  \n \n\n  \nbackground  could  be  construction  paper,  a  tarp,  or  a  sheet.  \u25cb  When  the  teacher  says  \u201cgo,\u201d  the  predator  walks  into  the  classroom  and  tries  to  \ufb01nd  as  many  organisms  as  they  can  in  20  seconds.  \u25a0  If  the  predator  picks  up  the  card,  this  means  that  the  organism  was  eaten.  \u25a0  The  other  students  stand  outside  of  the  predator\u2019s  environment  and  do  not  offer  help  or  interfere.  \u25cb  After  20  seconds,  students,  as  a  class,  count  the  remaining  lighter-colored  and  darker-colored  organisms.  \u25a0  Teacher  explains  that  Round  1  represents  one  generation  passing.  \u25a0  As  a  group,  students  \ufb02ip  over  their  cards  to  see  the  genotype  of  their  organisms.  \u25a0  Students  \ufb01nd  the  percentage  of  alleles  present  in  their  gene  pool  after  Round  1.  \u25cf  Students  count  the  number  of  alleles  left  on  the  tarp.  \u25cf  Students  count  letter  B  alleles  and  lowercase  b  alleles  and  then  add  them  together  to  get  the  total.  \u25cf  Students  \ufb01nd  allele  frequency  percentages.  \u25cb  The  predator  leaves  the  classroom  to  prepare  for  Round  2  of  the  game.  \u25cf  Students  complete  Round  2  of  the  game,  using  the  following  instructions:  \u25cb  Teacher  and  students  place  all  the  cards  back  in  the  game  for  Round  2,  even  cards  that  were  previously  picked  up  in  Round  1.  The  game  completely  starts  over.  \u25cb  This  time,  students  place  the  organism  cards  on  a  dark  background.  This  could  be  a  large  sheet  of  black  construction  paper,  a  sheet,  or  a  tarp.  \u25cb  When  the  teacher  says  \u201cGo,\u201d  the  predator  enters  the  room.  \u25cb  The  predator  tries  to  \ufb01nd  as  many  organisms  as  they  can  in  20  seconds.  \u25cb  Students  calculate  the  allele  frequency  of  the  organisms  living  in  this  imaginary  Arctic  biome  after  Round  2.  \u25a0  As  a  group,  students  \ufb02ip  over  their  cards  to  see  the  genotype  of  their  organism.  \u25a0  Students  count  how  many  alleles  are  present  in  their  population  at  the  end  of  Round  2.  \u25a0  Teacher  explains  that  Round  2  represents  one  generation  passing  in  this  new  environment.  \u25a0  Students  \ufb01nd  the  percentage  of  alleles  present  in  their  gene  pool.  This  is  done  by  counting  the  number  of  alleles  left  on  the  tarp.  Students  count  letter  B  alleles  and  lowercase  b  alleles  and  then  add  together  this  number  to  get  the  total.  \u25cf  The  rounds  of  the  game  can  be  repeated  if  needed.  \u25cf  At  the  end  of  the  game,  students  complete  the  Summary  Statement  section  of  the  Student  Document.  \u25cf  Students  come  back  together  as  a  large  group  and  discuss  the  following  scenario:  Imagine  a  snowy  environment  changing  to  a  wetter,  forest-like  environment  where  the  soil  is  more  visible,  similar  to  the  white  background  changing  to  a  darker  background  in  the  game.  \u25cf  Students  discuss  the  following  questions:  \n \n\n  \n\u25cb  What  would  be  potential  bene\ufb01ts  to  organisms  if  an  environment  changed  from  a  snowy  environment  to  a  forest  environment?  Easier  to  \ufb01nd  food,  more  plants  growing  in  soil,  and  more  habitats  and  niches  for  organisms  to  occupy.  \u25cb  What  would  be  potential  drawbacks  for  organisms  if  an  environment  changed  from  a  snowy  environment  to  a  forest  environment?  Less  genetic  diversity,  less  habitat  diversity,  less  biodiversity,  and  unforeseen  consequences  that  humans  are  unaware  of .  \nInspire  \u2245   30  minutes\n \n\u25cf  Students  watch  Erosion  in  Alaska:  Youth  and  Climate,  a  video  about  a  community  that  faces  challenges  due  to  a  changing  climate.  \u25cf  Students  participate  in  a  group  discussion  on  the  video  using  the  following  questions:  \u25cb  How  would  a  change  from  snowy  conditions  to  a  warmer  environment  affect  the  lifestyle  of  this  community?  The  people  might  have  to  change  how  they  get  their  food  and  where  they  live.  \u25cb  How  could  a  change  from  a  snowy  environment  to  a  more  forest-like  environment  affect  the  Alaskan  community\u2019s  diet?  There  could  be  less  \ufb01shing  and  this  would  affect  the  communities'  ability  to  \ufb01nd  food.  If  the  tundra  becomes  a  more  forest-like  environment,  the  community  could  plant  crops  and  raise  livestock  but  that  cannot  happen  on  unstable,  melting  permafrost.  \u25cb  How  does  Nelson  feel  about  the  changes?  He  feels  scared  that  his  community  will  lose  their  way  of  life.  \u25cf  Students  independently  read  this  article about  climate  migrants  and  watch  Alaskan  Native  Elders  Tell  Their  Climate  Change  Story:  After  the  Ice.  Note:  There  are  three  short  videos  in  this  series.  Teacher  can  assign  the  video  above,  which  is  the  third  video,  or  all  three.  \u25cf  Students  answer  the  following  questions  on  their  Student  Document:  \u25cb  What  does  the  term  climate  migrant  mean  to  you?   \u25cb  How  could  the  community  in  the  video  be  an  example  of  climate  migration?  \u25cb  How  would  you  feel  if  you  had  to  leave  your  community?  \u25cb  How  is  this  community  currently  being  affected  by  climate  change?  \u25cb  Do  you  think  all  communities  everywhere  are  being  affected  by  climate  change  in  the  same  way?  \u25cb  What  solutions  does  the  article  suggest?  If  you  had  to  choose  one  solution  to  focus  on,  which  would  you  choose?  Why?  \u25cf  Students  work  in  small  groups  to  create  a  mini-project  about  a  group  of  animals  (wild  \ufb01sh,  crustaceans,  marine  mammals,  Arctic  seabirds,  or  land  animals)  that  will  be  affected  by  climate  change  in  the  Arctic.  \u25cb  Students  use  this  Climate  Hub to  choose  a  group  of  animals.  Teacher  can  also  assign  each  group  a  different  group  of  animals  to  research.  \u25cb  Each  group  makes  a  poster,  Canva  infographic,  or  Google  Slideshow  that  includes:  \u25a0  The  name  of  the  animal  group  \u25a0  2  facts  about  how  the  animal  group  is  being  affected  by  climate  change  in  Alaska  \u25a0  1  fact  about  how  that  would  affect  the  diet  of  the  Alaskan  communities  \u25a0  A  picture  of  the  animal  \u25a0  An  explanation  of  how  a  change  in  the  animal's  physical  environment  may  \n \n\n  \naffect  the  allele  frequencies  of  that  organism\u2019s  gene  pool.  \u25cf  Students  display  their  work  in  a  virtual  gallery  walk  or  a  physical  gallery  walk  so  that  the  other  student  groups  can  view  it.  \u25cf  Students  complete  an  exit  ticket  or  discuss  as  a  class  the  following  re\ufb02ection  questions:  \u25cb  What  is  one  takeaway  you  want  to  remember  from  this  lesson?  \u25cb  What  was  it  like  learning  about  the  impact  of  climate  change  in  the  Arctic?  \u25cb  What  are  some  actions  that  individuals  can  take  to  help  mitigate  the  impact  of  climate  change  or  reduce  carbon  emissions?   \nAccompanying  Materials \nTeacher  Slideshow  \nStudent  Document  \nStudent  Game  Cards  \n \n \nTeaching  Tips\n \nPositives  \n\u25cf  This  lesson  could  be  used  in  an  environmental  science  or  biology  class.  \u25cf  This  lesson  could  be  used  to  supplement  a  variety  of  curricular  topics  such  as  genetics,  population  dynamics,  or  climate  change.  \n Prerequisites  \n\u25cf  Students  should  have  some  prior  knowledge  of  genetics.  \u25cf  To  prepare  in  advance  for  the  game  in  the  Investigate  section:   \u25cb  Print  and  cut  out  the  organism  cards.  \u25cb  Be  sure  to  have  on  hand  one  large  white  sheet  of  paper  or  tarp  and  one  large  black  sheet  of  paper  or  tarp.  \nDifferentiation  \n\u25cf  Teacher  can  make  any  of  the  following  adjustments  to  the  game  in  the  Investigate  section:  \u25cb  Use  the  third  slide  of  the  Game  Cards  to  add  organisms  and  allele  frequencies  \u25cb  Assign  different  students  to  be  the  predator  for  each  round  \u25cb  Add  additional  camou\ufb02age  to  the  sheet  such  as  leaves  or  other  decoy  organisms  \u25cb  Add  additional  student  predators  to  the  activity  by  having  the  predator  have  offspring  \u25cf  Higher-level  students  can  investigate  further  by  researching  the  albedo  effect and  how  albedo  is  changing  as  a  result  of  ice  melt.  \u25cf  Students  can  explore  climate  justice  and  the  impact  of  climate  change  on  people  living  in  the  Arctic  through  this  lesson from  ACE  and  this  lesson from  CLEAN.  \u25cf  Students  can  read this  article from  Arctic  Today  in  small  groups,  in  a  large  group,  or  in  place  of  the  video.  \n \n\n   \nLearning  Standards\n \nPrimary  Standards \nNext  Generation  Science  Standards  (NGSS)  PS,  LS,  ESS,  ETS  \nHS-LS3-3.
